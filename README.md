  Hello, I am Landon Schlangen. I am going to college at North Dakota State University and have successfully completed the Front End Web challenged issued to me by Bushell and Teri Winkelman. 

  I had a great time completing this challenge because it gave me something to do outside of class. Coding is a lot of fun and so is learning. I learned a lot by doing this challenge. It encouraged me to learn React, Node.js, and even a little bit of Redux. I learned html, css, and javascript on my own without college, and I made no exception here. React was awesome because it unlocked the power of javascript and made writing web applications a lot easier. Thank you Bushell for giving me this Pokemon coding challenge.


  If there are any features you would like me to implement and see if I can do that is not on the project, feel free to email me about it.
  
  Hope you like it!
  
  Thanks,
  Landon Schlangen
